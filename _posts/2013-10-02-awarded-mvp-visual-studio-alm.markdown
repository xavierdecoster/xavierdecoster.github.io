<p>I was quite thrilled and surprised yesterday to receive an email notification with the subject "<i>Congratulations 2013 Microsoft MVP!</i>".<br/></p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://xavierdecosterblog.blob.core.windows.net/blog/MVP-Logo.png" alt="MVP Logo"/></div>

<p>I'm really honored to receive this award and find great satisfaction in the fact that Microsoft and the Community are appreciating my efforts to share experiences and insights in terms of NuGet, Visual Studio and ALM in general.</p>

<p>I hope to keep up to your expectations and deliver quality in everything I do, and I'm really looking forward to see what the next 12 months will bring. Challenge accepted! :-)</p>

<p>Thank you Microsoft for the <a href="http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/overview.aspx" target="_blank">MVP award</a>. Thank you <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/belux/meet/" target="_blank">MEET</a> for the awesome work you do! Thank you Community for a great collaboration and for giving me the opportunity to grow as a developer and as a person. Thanks to everyone who supported me in my efforts, including family and friends, colleagues, MVPs and many more!</p>
