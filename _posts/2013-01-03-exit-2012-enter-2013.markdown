<p><p>I'm usually not the guy who spends too much time looking at the past, but 2012 has been so much fun I can't resist the temptation of summing up what I've enjoyed most.</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://www.myget.org" target="_blank">MyGet.org</a> - With <strong>6 feature-adding releases</strong> in 2012 and a few intermediate hotfix deployments along the way (from 1.0.x to 1.6.x), I've had a blast developing and moving this NuGet-as-a-Service platform to the next level. It’s great fun working with <a href="http://blog.maartenballiauw.be/" target="_blank">Maarten Balliauw</a> on our little pet project which experienced a few backlog explosions: glad we survived :). With tons of great stuff in the pipeline and numerous ideas yet to put on the drawing board, I'm sure this year will bring more MyGet goodness. </li>    <li><a href="http://bit.ly/ProNuGet" target="_blank">Pro NuGet</a> – In March 2012, <strong>my first book</strong> got released by Apress. Currently considering to write a vNext with more chapters or recipes dedicated to real world problems and scenarios. </li>    <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/belux/meet/default.aspx#Xavier+Decoster" target="_blank">MEET</a> – I’ve participated in lots of the 2012 events – including many Windows 8 hack-a-thons and an <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Continuous-Integration-using-TFS11--NuGet" target="_blank">MSDN Live Webcast</a> - as part of the Microsoft Extended Experts Team, a group of enthousiastic community members in Belgium. <b>Proud to be part of MEET</b> and looking forward to more awesomeness in 2013 (including <a href="www.microsoft.com/belux/techdays/" target="_blank">TechDays Belgium</a> in March)! </li>    <li>Technical writing – I’ve written a few articles and 21 blog posts in 2012 (and a few more on the MyGet <a href="http://blog.myget.org" target="_blank">blog</a>), including <strong>my first MSDN Magazine article</strong> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj851071.aspx" target="_blank">Top 10 NuGet (anti-)patterns</a> and a DeveloperFusion article on <a href="http://www.developerfusion.com/article/144809/continuous-integration-using-nuget-and-teamcity/" target="_blank">Continuous Integration using NuGet and TeamCity</a>. </li>    <li><a href="/community" target="_blank">Talks</a> – I’ve been lucky to give <strong>my first talk abroad</strong>: I had a blast at <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/xavierdecoster/ugialtnet-organize-your-chickens-nuget-for-the-enterprise" target="_blank">UgiAlt.NET</a> in Milan (great interactive audience!). I’d love to speak more in 2013 starting with the <a href="http://warmcrocconf.net/xavier.aspx" target="_blank">Warm Crocodile Conference</a> (Copenhagen) in a few weeks where I’ll be giving 2 sessions on NuGet. </li> </ul>  <p>In my day-to-day job as a <a href="http://www.realdolmen.com" target="_blank">RealDolmen</a> consultant, I’ve been working on <a href="http://www.nuget.org" target="_blank">NuGet</a>/ALM (both with TFS and TeamCity), I’ve set up an on-premise <a href="http://www.symbolsource.org" target="_blank">SymbolSource</a> repository, and delivered my first SignalR project in production. Much of this work has resulted in new ideas for MyGet and 15 issues logged for NuGet (I whish I could contribute more code instead, but hey, it's a start). Let’s hope some more Azure goodness can be added to the mix as well in 2013!</p>  <p>It’s really rewarding to be part of such great community, and a source of inspiration going forward. Also thank you <a href="http://ferventcoder.com" target="_blank">Rob Reynolds</a> for the interesting chats about <a href="http://www.chocolatey.org" target="_blank">Chocolatey</a> and other cool stuff; I owe you a beer if we get the chance to meet. <strong>Thanks to all of you</strong> for all the stuff I learned from you! Sharing is caring :) Let's get the best out of 2013!</p></p>
