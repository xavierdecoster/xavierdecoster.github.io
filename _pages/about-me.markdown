## More information

My name is Xavier Decoster. I was born July 20, 1984, in [Roeselare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roeselare), [Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium). My childhood dream was to become a pilot in the Belgian Air Force, but after spending 2 years in the [Royal Military Academy](http://www.rma.ac.be/en), I had to change plans for medical reasons. Aviation is still a huge passion of mine, but so is technology! I studied New Media and Communication Technology, and graduated magna cum laude from the [Technical University of Kortrijk](https://www.howest.be/) in 2007. On my blog, I will try to keep you up-to-date about my work and interests.
